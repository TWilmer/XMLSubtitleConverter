XMLSubtitleConverter
====================

Tool to convert subtiles found on ARD Mediathek to .sub format readable by mplayer 
It's free software under the GPL v2



Todo:
 - offset is not handled magically
 - frames per seconds is hard coded
  
Problems:
 - colors are decoded but mplayer dosn't show them
